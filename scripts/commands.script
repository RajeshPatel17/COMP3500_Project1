       Unless  otherwise  noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by [1m-[0m accepts [1m--[0m to signify the end of the options.  The [1m:[0m, [1mtrue[0m, [1mfalse[0m, and [1mtest[0m builtins[m
       do not accept options and do not treat [1m--[0m specially.  The [1mexit[0m, [1mlogout[0m, [1mbreak[0m, [1mcontinue[0m, [1mlet[0m, and [1mshift[0m builtins accept and process arguments beginning  with  [1m-[0m  without  requiring  [1m--[0m.   Other[m
       builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with [1m-[0m as invalid options and require [1m--[0m to prevent this interpretation.[m

              positional parameters when [4mfilename[24m is executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.  The return status is the status of the last command exited within the script  (0  if[m

              whose [4mvalue[24m is given.  A trailing space in  [4mvalue[24m causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.  For each [4mname[24m in the argument list for  which  no[m
              [4mvalue[24m is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.  [1mAlias[0m returns true unless a [4mname[24m is given for which no alias has been defined.[m

Usage: chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
  or:  chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
  or:  chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.
With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

  -c, --changes          like verbose but report only when a change is made
  -f, --silent, --quiet  suppress most error messages
  -v, --verbose          output a diagnostic for every file processed
      --no-preserve-root  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
      --preserve-root    fail to operate recursively on '/'
      --reference=RFILE  use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values
  -R, --recursive        change files and directories recursively
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
